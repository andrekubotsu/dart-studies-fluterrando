# Lessons from Jacob Moura - udemy course "Lógica de programação com Dart"

It is a quite comprehensive lessons about Dart language. Some little projects were made (all uploaded in this repository). 

I've attended this course in order too be able to work with Flutter at NLW#5 event from Rocketseat - Flutter Track.

======================

To help me remember:

The Dart extension for VSCode is really interesting and helpful. The lesson "project structures" used a command: ctrl + shift + P : 'Dart:New Project'.
